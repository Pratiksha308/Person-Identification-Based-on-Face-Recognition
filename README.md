# Person-Identification-Based-on-Face-Recognition
This project is a Person-Identification-Based-on-Face-Recognition system that uses OpenCV and Python. The system uses a camera Module to capture images of individuals and then compares them with the images in the database to give authorized entry. If the person is known then it gives authorized entry otherwise it shows the person is unknown.
